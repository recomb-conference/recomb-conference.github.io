# RECOMB Website 

### About
This project is the website template and content used for RECOMB.

This site is based on [Project Zeppelin](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin). Project Zeppelin is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHub’s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Template is brought by [GDG Lviv](http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/) team.

The default Project Zeppelin files were then modified by [Jaime Ruiz](https://jaimeruiz.com/) to serve the [RECOMB-Seq webpage](https://recomb-seq.github.io/). This updated template was then used to create the RECOMB web page by [Can Alkan](http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~calkan/), with help from [Şeymanur Kılıç](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%9Feymanur-k-080060227/).
