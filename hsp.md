The safety of conference participants is RECOMB’s top priority. Participants should be aware that, while RECOMB will make every effort to reduce health risks on-site, it is possible that attendees may come into contact with individuals who carry communicable diseases during travel or while attending the event. RECOMB recommends that attendees follow public health guidelines and take precautions to protect themselves and others. RECOMB believes the most effective way for participants to maximize their own safety is to take appropriate preventive measures, including vaccinations if eligible and able.

Participants of RECOMB conferences understand that it is their responsibility to review and ensure compliance with any stated country guidelines both for entering the country and departing to return to their country of origin. Costs associated with travel are the responsibility of the participant.


##### On-Site Safety Measures

Public health guidance on preventing the transmission of communicable diseases continues to evolve, and RECOMB will base its on-site protocols on the latest guidance.

##### Protective Masks

The wearing of protective masks is not required. Participants are welcome to bring and wear a mask if they choose. RECOMB reserves the right to alter this protocol as appropriate at any time.

##### Symptom Development While Onsite

On-site participants must agree that if they become symptomatic, they will immediately cease in-person participation in the meeting and get tested for illness. Individuals who test positive for a communicable disease should not continue attending the meeting in-person until symptom free.

##### Conference Refund Policy

If a registered participant is unable to attend due to illness, RECOMB will partially refund the registration fee. Refund requests must be made prior to the start of the conference and accompanied by appropriate documentation.

##### RECOMB Health and Safety Waiver

Upon registration to the conference, RECOMB will require all in-person participants to sign the following waiver:

I understand that travel and gathering involves risk of sickness, including communicable diseases. I waive and release RECOMB and its sponsors and exhibitors, and their employees and agents, from and against claims, liabilities, and expenses arising from injury, sickness, or death from contraction or spread of communicable disease due to travel to or attendance at a RECOMB event.

I will take necessary precautions while at the event. I agree to inform the designated RECOMB Organizing Committee if I feel ill or have had recent exposure to a communicable disease case. This waiver and release is binding on me.
